# Renewable Energy and Good Governance in Africa

This project was created as part M.S. Data Visualization program at Parsons School of Design at The New School. In partnership with UNDP's Regional Bureau Africa office, students developed visualizations to accompany the publication [Transforming lives through
renewable energy access in Africa: UNDPâ€™s Contributions](http://www.africa.undp.org/content/dam/rba/docs/Issue%20Briefs/Africa_Renewable_Energy_v8_web.pdf)

Renewable Energy and Good Governance seeks to view renewable energy in Africa through the lens of [SDG 16](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16) by pairing [World Governance Indicators](http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#home) data and renewable energy potential and capacity data.
