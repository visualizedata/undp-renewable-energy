			"summary" : "Most countries in North Africa have made significant progress toward increasing\nchildren’s school enrolment, attendance and completion. However, access remains unequal and the quality of education is a\nmajor issue in the region. UNICEF is working with governments to tackle constraints to the effective delivery of quality education\nservices for all children.  Central to UNICEF's approach to strengthening education systems is improving the availability and use of data.\nUNICEF does this by advocating for the empowerment of schools to collect, analyze, monitor, and act on data to address equity, learning and system efficiency challenges.",

Often, parents cannot afford the direct and indirect costs,\nsuch as school books and uniforms, of their children’s schooling. Qualified teachers are in short supply, and many schools are located\nfar away from children’s homes, a factor that can increase the risk of sexual abuse and harassment for girls. Lack of access to safe\nwater and separate latrines for boys and girls can also discourage\nchildren, especially girls, from attending school. These barriers,\ncoupled with other obstacles - disability, exclusion and emergencies, for example - create high levels of out-of-school children for ESA.",
