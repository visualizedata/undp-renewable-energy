Focus on SDG 8
General exploration -- How can acting on renewable energy potential improve the ease of doing business in Sub-Saharan Africa?

Prompt
I'm visualizing access to electricity in Sub-Saharan countries that have a poor ease of doing business ranking because I want to show how access to electricity greatly impacts the ability to do business in order to promote action on renewable energy potential to improve the ease of doing business
