IC.BUS.EASE.XQ      ,Ease of doing business index (1=easiest to 183=most difficult),"Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business, from 1 (easiest) to 183 (most difficult). A good (low) score on the ease of doing business index means the regulatory environment is conducive to the operation of business. This index averages the country's percentile rankings on 10 topics, made up of a variety of indicators, giving equal weight to each topic. The 2009 rankings are from Doing Business 2010: Reforming through Difficult Times, covering the period June 2008 through May 2009.","World Bank, Doing Business Project (http://www.doingbusiness.org/economyranking)"
IC.GE.NUM           ,Procedures required to connect to electricity (number),"This indicator records the number of procedures required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection and supply for a warehouse. To ensure that data are comparable across economies, a standard case study in which an entrepreneur seeks to connect a newly built warehouse for cold meat storage to electricity was used. Data are collected from the electricity distribution utility, then completed and verified by independent professionals such as electricians, electrical engineers, electrical contractors, and construction companies.

IC.REG.DURS         ,Time required to start a business (days),"The number of calendar days needed to complete all required procedures to legally operate a commercial or industrial firm are recorded by this indicator.  Requirements may include obtaining necessary licenses and permits as well as completing any required notifications, verifications, and inscriptions for the company and its employees with relevant authorities. The measure captures the median duration that incorporation lawyers indicate is necessary to complete each procedure.  If a procedure can be speeded up at additional cost, the fastest procedure, independent of cost, is chosen.
